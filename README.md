# World-Internet-Access
A DataCamp Competition to discover how much of the world has access to the internet.
A fictitious background for a policy consulting firm was created.
The following questions were answered:
1. What are the top 5 countries with the highest internet use (by population share)?
2. How many people had internet access in those countries in 2019?
3. What are the top 5 countries with the highest internet use for each of the following regions: 'Middle East & North Africa', 'Latin America & Caribbean', 'East Asia &    Pacific', 'South Asia', 'North America', 'Europe & Central Asia'?
4. Create a visualization for those five regions' internet usage over time.
5. What are the 5 countries with the most internet users?
6. What is the correlation between internet usage (population share) and broadband subscriptions for 2019?

Three datasets were made availbale. Link to datasets: ([source](https://ourworldindata.org/internet))
